The semester has started and we're ready for it!

2025 has been a busy time so far, but at UCR the academic year starts in March! I am teaching an elective course on Fungicides with eight very eager students. We continueour work on Streptomyces, cashew trees, and more things are coming up very soon, so stay tuned!
